# LabsPT22-Sprint1

Our team decided to focus on building a bot that would act as a NPC (Non-Player) to fix a lack of available players. This will aloow players to feel as if they are surrounded by other players willing to read and create with them.

We hope that the user will have a more enjoyable interaction with the app to promote continued use if the user sees more people playing.

I believe this is the right choice for the direction. We hope this won't take much longer than 1 - 2 months to implement.


The databse chosen was POSTgresql.

Many of the choices that we provided as it came to database, or libraries were already implemented in the project. Our collective knowledge fit better in the provided libraries so we kept with what was provided.

We may run in to some risks later on if the bots/npc we implement will require a different library which might not be compatible with another.

The largest challenge I forsee will be scaling our project.

So far we are preparing to build 1-2 bots per team, while I believe a realistic approach will be to build estimating that only 1 player in a cohort will be real.
